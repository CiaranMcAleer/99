# Example 1: Simple function request
# calculate_fibonacci - Generate Fibonacci sequence up to n terms
# Return a list of numbers

# Example 2: Data processing function
# filter_users - Filter a list of user dictionaries
# Keep only users with 'active' status set to True
# Sort by 'created_at' field in descending order
# Return the filtered and sorted list

# Example 3: API integration
# fetch_weather - Make an HTTP GET request to weather API
# Endpoint: https://api.weather.com/current?city={city}
# Parse JSON response and extract temperature, humidity, conditions
# Return a dictionary with these keys
# Handle network errors and return None if request fails

# Example 4: File operations
# read_csv_data - Read a CSV file from the given path
# Parse it into a list of dictionaries where keys are column names
# Skip empty rows and strip whitespace from values
# Return the parsed data or raise FileNotFoundError if file doesn't exist

# Example 5: Class method
class DataProcessor:
    # Constructor that initializes with a config dictionary
    # Config should contain 'batch_size' and 'max_workers' keys
    # Set defaults: batch_size=100, max_workers=4
    pass

# Example 6: Validation logic
# validate_password - Check if password meets security requirements
# Requirements: at least 8 characters, one uppercase, one lowercase, one number
# Return True if valid, False otherwise
# Also return a list of requirement failures for user feedback

# Example 7: Data transformation
# transform_json_to_xml - Convert a JSON string to XML format
# Preserve nested structure using proper XML tags
# Handle arrays by creating repeated elements
# Return the XML string or raise ValueError if JSON is invalid

def main():
    pass
